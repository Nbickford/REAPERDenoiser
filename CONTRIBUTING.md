# How to contribute to the REAPERDenoiser JSFX Plugin

First off, thanks for taking the time to contribute!

Here are some ways you can help! Keep in mind that this project is meant to be short and accessible to beginners.
Additionally, changes to the code will also be changed in the tutorial currently located at https://www.neilbickford.com/blog/2020/02/02/a-real-time-jsfx-audio-denoiser-for-reaper/;
by updating the code, you also let me know that it's OK for me to push those changes there.

### Reporting Bugs
Incompatibility with some JSFX hosts? Usability/accessibility issues? State not serializing properly or plugin behaving in
unusual ways? That's good for us to know about! Please open a new issue at https://github.com/Nbickford/REAPERDenoiser/issues
and include as much as you can about the problem. Images, video, or audio that we can look at to try to figure out what's going
on are appreciated, but not required.

### Suggesting Enhancements
This one's a bit trickier, but if there are any improvements that can be made to the plugin while keeping the code
sufficiently simple (since one use case for this is people who are new to programming typing it into their JSFX editors
and trying to understand it!) please also let us know by creating an issue. If you know what changes you want to make to
the denoiser, you can also create a pull request that will then be reviewed!

For documentation, improvements are always appreciated. You can create issues or pull requests for those, or if you have
any suggested modifications for the blog, you can create an issue or pull request for it here as well, create a comment
on the blog, or email me at <nbickford@ucla.edu>.

If you have some ideas for the denoiser that are more experimental or take it on more of a tangent, that's great! This
denoiser is intended to be modified by the people who are using it. In that case, please feel free to make a fork of this
denoiser, or to create your own denoiser using the code from this repository - you can absolutely do that under the MIT
license this uses, and we recommend doing so!

### Letting us know where it's been used
It's always neat to get to know where this plugin's been used! You can let us know where it's been used by commenting on the
blog post, creating an issue, or emailing me at <nbickford@ucla.edu>. In the future, I might add a section to the README listing
places where it's been used, but I'll ask you for permission before listing your project there.
