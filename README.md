# REAPERDenoiser

*Looking for the JSFX plugin? Get it [here](https://github.com/Nbickford/REAPERDenoiser/raw/master/REAPERDenoiser), and see the install instructions below!*

A JSFX denoiser for REAPER based on Norbert Weiner's [deconvolution algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wiener_deconvolution). This reduces some of the artifacts you get when using a REAFir subtraction-based approach, but also removes noise more gently. You can also set the Noise Scale value to high levels [to produce a bell-like effect](https://www.neilbickford.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/out.mp4)!

This denoiser was used to remove background noise for several GME videos, including the Celeste Celeste Collections videos. Now, it's open-source!

For more information about the denoiser, please see the accompanying blog post at https://www.neilbickford.com/blog/2020/02/02/a-real-time-jsfx-audio-denoiser-for-reaper/. That blog post also includes a tutorial, which walks you through the steps of learning JSFX and writing this denoiser on your own!

2. Download the REAPERDenoiser JSFX file by clicking on REAPERDenoiser above, clicking on "Raw", and saving the file, or directly from https://github.com/Nbickford/REAPERDenoiser/raw/master/REAPERDenoiser.

That's it!
